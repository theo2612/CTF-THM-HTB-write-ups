    018-04-23: I've been messing with that struts stuff, and it's pretty cool! I think it might be neat
    to host that on this server too. Haven't made any real web apps yet, but I have tried that example
    you get to show off how it works (and it's the REST version of the example!). Oh, and right now I'm 
    using version 2.5.12, because other versions were giving me trouble. -K

    2018-04-22: SMB has been configured. -K

    2018-04-21: I got Apache set up. Will put in our content later. -J

    For J:

    I've been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don't have any weak credentials,
    and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
    it? Change that password ASAP.
